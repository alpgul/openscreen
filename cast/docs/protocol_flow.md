# Cast Protocol Flow Overview

## Introduction

The Cast protocol involves a sequence of interactions between a Sender device
and a Receiver device to establish a connection, launch an application, and
stream media. This document provides a high-level overview of this flow.

The key stages are:

1. **Discovery:** The Sender finds the Receiver on the local network.
2. **Connection Establishment:** A secure channel is created between the two
    devices.
3. **Application Launch/Session Establishment:** The Sender requests the
    Receiver to launch a specific application.
4. **Streaming Setup:** Media streaming parameters are negotiated.
5. **Media Streaming:** Media is transported from Sender to Receiver.
6. **Teardown:** The session is terminated.

## Key Messages and States

### Discovery

- The Sender broadcasts a Multicast DNS (mDNS) query for services of type
  `_googlecast._tcp.local`.
- Cast Receivers on the network respond with their IP address, port, and
  device information.

### Connection Establishment

- The Sender establishes a TCP connection to the Receiver's IP address and
  port.
- A TLS handshake is performed to create a secure channel.
- The CastV2 protocol handshake occurs over this secure channel, where devices
  authenticate each other and exchange capabilities.

### Application Launch

- The Sender sends a `LAUNCH` message to the Receiver, requesting it to start
  a specific application (identified by an App ID).
- The Receiver launches the application (e.g., a web-based media player) in
  its own environment. Once ready, the Receiver informs the Sender of the
  application's status and provides a unique `sessionId`.

### Streaming Setup

- Using the Cast Streaming Control Protocol (CSCP), the Sender and Receiver
  negotiate streaming parameters via an `OFFER`/`ANSWER` exchange.
- This negotiation determines codecs, resolutions, bitrates, and the UDP ports
  to be used for media transport.

### Media Streaming

- The Sender begins encoding media and streaming it to the Receiver as a
  sequence of RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) packets over UDP.
- The Receiver receives, decodes, and renders the media.
- RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) packets are exchanged periodically to provide
  feedback on stream quality, synchronization, and to handle packet loss.

### Teardown

- When the streaming session is finished, the Sender sends a `STOP` message to
  terminate the application on the Receiver, or simply closes the connection.
